# Waze User Churn Prediction Model

## Purpose
This project builds a machine learning model to predict Waze user churn and identify factors contributing to retention or churn.

## Key Steps
1. **Ethical Considerations**:
   - Evaluate the ethical implications of the model and consider adjustments to objectives.
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Perform feature selection, extraction, and transformation to prepare the dataset for modeling.
3. **Modeling**:
   - Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict user churn.
   - Provide actionable business recommendations based on model results.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, Numpy
- Matplotlib/Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Pickle

## Deliverables
- Churn prediction models with performance evaluation.
- Insights and recommendations for improving user retention.
