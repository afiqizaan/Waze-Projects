# Waze-Projects
This repository contains a series of projects focused on analyzing Waze user data. The projects involve exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, logistic regression, and churn prediction modeling to uncover insights and support business decisions for user retention.

## Project Highlights

### 1. [Course 2: Waze Data Understanding](./Course2_Waze_Data_Understanding)
- **Objective**: Investigate and organize Waze's dataset for initial analysis and preparation for further exploration.
- **Key Focus**: Dataframe creation, summary statistics, and variable exploration.

### 2. [Course 3: Waze Exploratory Data Analysis](./Course3_Waze_Exploratory_Data_Analysis)
- **Objective**: Perform deeper EDA on Waze's dataset to reveal trends and relationships.
- **Key Focus**: Data cleaning, visualization, and initial insights.

### 3. [Course 4: Waze Hypothesis Testing and Insights](./Course4_Waze_Hypothesis_Testing_and_Insights)
- **Objective**: Conduct hypothesis tests to uncover factors influencing user behavior.
- **Key Focus**: Descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, and actionable insights.

### 4. [Course 5: Waze Logistic Regression Model](./Course5_Waze_Logistic_Regression_Model)
- **Objective**: Build and evaluate a logistic regression model to predict user behavior.
- **Key Focus**: EDA, logistic regression modeling, and interpreting results.

### 5. [Course 6: Waze User Churn Prediction Model](./Course6_Waze_User_Churn_Prediction_Model)
